Follow the guide in the README.\n\nIf none of these fix the issue, please open an issue on the Github repository: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo`);\n}\n\n/**\n * We export the native interface in this way to give easy shared access to it between the\n * JavaScript code and the tests\n */\nlet nativeEventEmitter: NativeEventEmitter | null = null;\nexport default {\n  ...RNCNetInfo,\n  get eventEmitter(): NativeEventEmitter {\n    if (!nativeEventEmitter) {\n      /// @ts-ignore\n      nativeEventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(RNCNetInfo);\n    }\n    /// @ts-ignore\n    return nativeEventEmitter;\n  },\n};\n"]}
